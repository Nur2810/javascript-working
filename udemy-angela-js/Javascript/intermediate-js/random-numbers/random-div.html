        We all know that a name can tell a lot about a person. Names are not
        randomly chosen: they all have a meaning. Doctor Love knew this so he
        made another great invention just for the lonely you!

      <div class="a">
      <p> Sometimes you'd like to know if a relationship with someone could work
        out. Therefore Doctor Love himself designed this great machine for you.
        With The Love Calculator you can calculate the probability of a
        successful relationship between two people. The Love Calculator is an
        affective way to get an impression of what the chances are on a
        relationship between two people.</p>
