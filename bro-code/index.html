      Turkey,[a] officially the Republic of Türkiye,[b] is a country mainly in
      Anatolia in West Asia, with a smaller part called East Thrace in Southeast
      Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia, Armenia,
      Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq, Syria, and the Mediterranean Sea
      (and Cyprus) to the south; and the Aegean Sea, Greece, and Bulgaria to the
      west. Turkey is home to over 85 million people; most are ethnic Turks,
      while ethnic Kurds are the largest ethnic minority.[4] Officially a
      secular state, Turkey has a Muslim-majority population. Ankara is Turkey's
      capital and second-largest city; Istanbul is its largest city, and its
      economic and financial center, as well as the largest city in Europe.
      Other major cities include İzmir, Bursa and Antalya.<br /><br />

      Human habitation began in the Late Paleolithic.[11] Home to important
      Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe and some of the earliest farming areas,
      present-day Turkey was inhabited by various ancient peoples.[12][13][14]
      Hattians were assimilated by the incoming Anatolian peoples.[15][16]
      Increasing diversity during Classical Anatolia transitioned into cultural
      Hellenization following the conquests of Alexander the Great;[17][18]
      Hellenization continued during the Roman and Byzantine eras.[19][20] The
      Seljuk Turks began migrating into Anatolia in the 11th century, starting
      the Turkification process.[20][21] The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum ruled
      Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into
      Turkish principalities.[22] Beginning in 1299, the Ottomans united the
      principalities and expanded; Mehmed II conquered Istanbul in 1453. During
      the reigns of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire
      became a global power.[23][24] From 1789 onwards, the empire saw major
      transformation, reforms, and centralization while its territory declined.
