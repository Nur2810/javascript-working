      Turkey,[a] officially the Republic of Türkiye,[b] is a country mainly in
      Anatolia in West Asia, with a smaller part called East Thrace in Southeast
      Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia, Armenia,
      Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq, Syria, and the Mediterranean Sea
      (and Cyprus) to the south; and the Aegean Sea, Greece, and Bulgaria to the
      west. Turkey is home to over 85 million people; most are ethnic Turks,
      while ethnic Kurds are the largest ethnic minority.[4] Officially a
      secular state, Turkey has a Muslim-majority population. Ankara is Turkey's
      capital and second-largest city; Istanbul is its largest city, and its
      economic and financial center, as well as the largest city in Europe.
      Other major cities include İzmir, Bursa and Antalya.<br><br>
